       <h2>About myself</h2>
       <p> Through my professional life I have held down a plethora of different and somewhat odd jobs.  From managing Beer stands to working in the digital marketing field I found that my calling was coding.</p>

       <p> At an early age I love building Legos and puzzles  but I would have never guessed that they would lead me to the coding field.  Coding projects are neither quick nor easy but the tedious and meticulous work often yields beautiful projects and intricate designs.</p>

       <p> As a website designer and constantly looking for new and innovative ways to make my websites the best they could possibly be along with the most drawing to the human eye.</p>
